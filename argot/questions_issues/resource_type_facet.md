# Setting `resource_type` facet values based on MARC bibliographic data
## Video games
Some thoughts:
LDR/06 (type of record) = m (computer file)
AND
008/26 and/or 006/09 (type of computer file) = g (Game)

Seems like everything that is a video game should at least have those, but I don't know the extent to which records do.

Other ideas: 
- 655 = Video games and/or 655 = Computer games
- presence of 6XX $v = Computer games
- 380 = Video game (though I think this usage is pretty new)

Platform tends to be coded in the 250 (edition statement), 753 (System Details Access to Computer Files), and/or 655 (genre/form) fields, but you'd need to assess which of these gives you the most coverage of your game collection and how standardized the vocabulary is. 

Looks like there are actually LC subject headings "Xbox video games" and "Sony video games" (use for "Sony Playstation video games"), etc. so that might be your best bet there if you've assigned those headings...
