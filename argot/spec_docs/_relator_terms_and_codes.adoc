= MARC relator terms and codes

toc::[]

== What are they?
Values that specify the relationship between an agent (represented by name recorded in catalog record) and resource described by the catalog record. 

== Processing notes

=== watch out for X11 fields
In X00 and X10 fields the relator term is recorded in $e.

In X11 the relator term is recorded in $j. In X11, $e is the name of a subordinate unit.

=== drop if included in name/title fields
Name/title fields are always supposed to be constructed with the main creator in the name portion.

Because the name/title field should follow rules that create structured data, catalogers are not supposed to record relator terms/codes in name/title fields.

If a relator term/code is erroneously included in a name/title field, drop it from the data mapped to Argot.
