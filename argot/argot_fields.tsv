Subject facet in Endeca was populated with terms from subject headings (not whole headings).

Not shown in individual records.;;;field_name includes ""lcsh"" because in Endeca, we also have a Medical Subject headings topic facet -- erring on the side of being more specific earlier on, based on Luke's advice that it'd be easier to generalize things later on than to tease out lost specifics."

Not shown in individual records.;;;field_name doesn't include name of a vocabulary because we've never treated genre terms from different vocabularies separately. I'll be making a case to POs that it's necessary to include terms from several non-LCSH vocabularies in this facet to make it at all useful. "
