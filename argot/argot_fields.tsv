subject_topic_lcsh_facet	subject	topic_lcsh_facet	y	y	y	n	Topical terms from LCSH	"Populates Subject facet. Subject facet in Endeca was populated with terms from subject headings (not whole headings). TD-347 specifies ""limited to LCSH,"" though Endeca data model allowed terms from other vocabularies to be mapped here"	.	subject_topic	"Deduplicate values in array/hash before index.;;;I said stored?=y because the value does need to display, but only as a facet value. Not shown in individual records.;;;field_name includes ""lscsh"" because in Endeca, we also have a Medical Subject headings topic facet -- erring on the side of being more specific earlier on, based on Luke's advice that it'd be easier to generalize things later on than to tease out lost specifics."
subject_genre_facet	subject	genre_facet	y	y	y	n	Genre/form terms	Populates Genre facet	.	subject_genre	"Deduplicate values in array/hash before index.;;;I said stored?=y because the value does need to display, but only as a facet value. Not shown in individual records.;;;field_name doesn't include name of a vocabulary because we've never treated genre terms from different vocabularies separately. I'll be making a case to POs that it's necessary to include terms from several non-LCSH vocabularies in this facet to make it at all useful. "
