* About the files here
This is currently a mess because it's early in the process. Stuff will be restructured/clarified later...

 - .tsv and .txt files: data documentation/mapping files
   - *IMPORTANT WARNING!*: data files beginning with _ are generated based on other data files. Do not edit them directly, or you will lose your edits.
 - .rb files: ruby scripts that:
   - extract data documentation/mapping files from code, config files, or other data sources
   - manipulate data documentation/mapping files -- combining, summarizing, etc.
 - .org files - notes, textual documentation, tasks, etc.
