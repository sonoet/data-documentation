* What's here? 
The files in this directory define the current MARC standard, as defined for programmatic consumption at:

http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdlist.html

* Input/data source files
Pulls data from http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdlist.html

* Result/reference files *(DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY)*
** _marc_bib_tags.tsv
List of all MARC fields, current and obsolete. Fields that have been renamed/redefined will display only latest name. 

This affords: 
 - Identifying unmapped MARC fields for decisionmaking about future mapping
** _marc_bib_subfields.tsv
List of all MARC subfields, current and obsolete. Subfields that have been renamed/redefined will display only latest name. 

This affords: 
 - verifying, for instance, that subfield 3 is NEVER anything BUT "Materials specified" -- we can safely create a universal handler for $3 data
 - mashing up with other data to produce list of unmapped subfields from mapped fields


* Scripts
** extract_marc_bib_spec.rb
Grabs LC MARC definition and produces the result/reference files

Usage: ruby extract_marc_bib_spec.rb
