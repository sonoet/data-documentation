#+TITLE: Preparation of Endeca-related data 

* endeca_dmod_elements.txt: list of unique elements from Endeca data model spreadsheet from the following tabs/columns (dmod_fields tab): 
| Tab          | Column                |
| Dimensions   | Endeca_Dimension_Name |
| Properties   | Endeca_Property       |
| EAD mappings | Endeca_Property       |
* Notice that data model spreadsheet is not in full agreement with some things in the actual Endeca configuration and extract separate lists of elements and information about them from the Endeca config.
** endeca_dimensions.tsv: Extract dimension names and behavior from serverc: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/Dimensions.xml, using top-level dimension nodes only.
*** Call Number Range dimension defined in: ./data/TRLN/config/pipeline/LCC_NLM_full.xml:  <DIMENSION NAME="Call Number Range" SRC_TYPE="INTERNAL">
*** Language dimension defined in: ./data/TRLN/config/pipeline/language_utf8.xml:  <DIMENSION NAME="Language" SRC_TYPE="INTERNAL">
*** Data on facet refinement behavior extracted from: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.refinement_config.xml
** endeca_properties.tsv: Extract property information from /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.prop_refs.xml
*** Sortable data extracted from: serverc: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.record_sort_config.xml
*** System primary key extracted from: serverc: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.record_spec.xml
*** Filter value extracted from: serverc: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.record_filter.xml
** endeca_config_elements.txt: From the lists of Endeca dimensions and propties derived from the Endeca configuration files, create a unique list of Endeca element names from the config
** endeca_indexing.tsv: Define which elements are searchable in which indexes, by extracting configuration from: serverc: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.recsearch_config.xml
** endeca_indexing_reduced.tsv: derived from endeca_indexing.tsv via endeca_indexing_reduce.rb
* Identify list of elements in endeca_dmod_elements.txt that are NOT in endeca_config_elements.txt

* Everything in endeca_dmod_elements.txt but not endeca_config_elements.txt was either
** in endeca_config_elements.txt with slightly different name
** deleted from data model but left in spreadsheet and formatted with strikethrough text
** a special Segmented element, which we don't care about, as per the next step
* *Thus we now consider endeca_config_elements.txt to be the final, authoritative element list going forward*
* Create new Elements tab, duplicating ElementsConfig, for revision moving forward.
* Remove elements with "Normalized" in the property/dimension name, since we assume Solr will be handling normalization. This results in removal of the following from the element list:
- Authors Normalized
- Journal Title Normalized
- Main Author Normalized
- Main Title Normalized
- Notes Normalized
- Publisher Normalized
- Series Normalized
- Subjects Normalized
- Titles Normalized
* Remove elements with "Vernacular" (and "Vernacular Segmented") in the name, since we assume we are handling vernacular data very differently in Solr. The following are removed: 
- Edition Vernacular
- Edition Vernacular Segmented
- Imprint Vernacular
- Main Author Vernacular
- Main Author Vernacular Segmented
- Main Uniform Title Vernacular
- Main Uniform Title Vernacular Segmented
- Other Authors Vernacular Segmented
- Other Titles Vernacular Segmented
- Series Statement Vernacular
- Series Statement Vernacular Segmented
- Statement of Responsibility Vernacular
- Statement of Responsibility Vernacular Segmented
- Subjects Vernacular Segmented
- Table of Contents Vernacular Segmented
- Title Vernacular
- Title Vernacular Segmented
- Uniform Title Vernacular
- Uniform Title Vernacular Segmented
- Varying Titles Vernacular Segmented
* Remove elements: Title1, Title2, Title3, Title4 on the assumption that we'll have better ways to deal with relevance ranking for short titles.
* To Element tab, add column indicating whether we facet on the element, and whether it is searchable
* Add column: Endeca dmod name, to facilitate matching MARC tags to elements they get mapped into
Element name here is from the Endeca config, which, as we saw above, sometimes had elements named differently than the data model spreadsheet
